# Pay-A-Bit

A standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins.

### Includes

Note that if you include your own classes, or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said files may go:

* `plugin-name/includes` is where functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts of the site reside
* `plugin-name/admin` is for all admin-specific functionality
* `plugin-name/public` is for all public-facing functionality
